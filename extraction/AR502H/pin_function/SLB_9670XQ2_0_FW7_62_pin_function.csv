NO,Pin Name,Pin Function,Pin description
1,NCI/VDD,Not Connected Internally/VDD,"This pin is not connected internally (can be connected externally). Note that pin 1 is defined as VDD in the TCG specification [3]. To be compliant, VDD can be connected to this pin."
2,GND,Ground,"All GND pins must be connected externally."
3,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
4,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
5,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
6,GPIO,GPIO-Express-00 Signal,"The TPM2.0 device does not use this functionality. This pin may be left unconnected; it has an internal pull-up resistor."
7,PP,Physical Presence,"The TPM2.0 device does not use this functionality. This pin may be left unconnected; it has an internal pulldown resistor."
8,VDD,Power Supply,"All VDD pins must be connected externally and should be bypassed to GND via 100 nF capacitors."
9,GND,Ground,"All GND pins must be connected externally."
10,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
11,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
12,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
13,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
14,NCI/VDD,Not Connected Internally/VDD,"This pin is not connected internally (can be connected externally). Note that pin 14 is defined as VDD in the TCG specification [3]. To be compliant and to ensure upwards compatibility to future TPMs, VDD must be connected to this pin."
15,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
16,NCI/GND,Not Connected Internally/GND,"This pin is not connected internally (can be connected externally). Note that pin 16 is defined as GND in the TCG specification [3]. To be compliant, GND can be connected to this pin."
17,RST#,Reset,"External reset signal. Asserting this pin unconditionally resets the device. The signal is active low and is typically connected to the PCIRST# signal of the host. This pin has a weak internal pull-up resistor."
18,PIRQ#,Interrupt Request,"Interrupt request signal to the host. The pin has no internal pull-up resistor. The interrupt is active low."
19,SCLK,SPI Clock,"The SPI clock signal. Only SPI mode 0 is supported by the device."
20,CS#,Chip Select,"The SPI chip select signal (active low)."
21,MOSI,Master Out Slave In (SPI Data),"SPI data which is received from the master."
22,VDD,Power Supply,"All VDD pins must be connected externally and should be bypassed to GND via 100 nF capacitors."
23,GND,Ground,"All GND pins must be connected externally."
24,MISO,Master In Slave Out (SPI Data),"SPI data which is sent to the SPI bus master."
25,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
26,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
27,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
28,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
29,NC,No Connect,"All pins must not be connected externally (must be left floating)."
30,NC,No Connect,"All pins must not be connected externally (must be left floating)."
31,NCI,Not Connected Internally,"All pins are not connected internally (can be connected externally)."
32,GND,Ground,"All GND pins must be connected externally."
