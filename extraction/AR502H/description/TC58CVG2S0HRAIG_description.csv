General Description
"The TC58CVG2S0HRAIG is a Serial Interface NAND Flash memory for embedded applications which supports the SPI interface. The TC58CVG2S0HRAIG is organized as (4096 + 128) bytes x 64 pages x 2048 blocks. The device has a 4224 byte data buffer which allows program and read data to be transferred between the buffer and the memory cell array in 4224-byte increments. The Erase operation is implemented in a single block unit (256 Kbytes + 8 Kbytes: 4224 bytes x 64 pages). The device has the high speed mode for sequential Page Read operation. When high speed mode is enabled, the average tR is shortened. The TC58CVG2S0HRAIG has ECC logic on the chip and 8bit read errors for each (512 bytes + 16 bytes) can be corrected. The internal ECC logic has detailed Bit Flip Count Report."
