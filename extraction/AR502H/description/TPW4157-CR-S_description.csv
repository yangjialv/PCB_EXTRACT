General Description
"The TPW4157 is a high-performance Single Pole/Double Throw (SPDT) analog switch. It features an ultra-low on-state resistance of 1.15 Î© maximum at 4.5 V Vcc and supports a wide supply range from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. Its very low quiescent current operation makes it ideal for portable applications, providing a direct interface with processor general purpose I/Os even when the control voltage is lower than Vcc."
