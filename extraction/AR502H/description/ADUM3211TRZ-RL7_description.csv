General Description
"The ADuM3210/ADuM3211 are dual-channel digital isolators based on Analog Devices, Inc., iCoupler® technology. Combining high speed CMOS and monolithic transformer technology, this isolation component provides outstanding performance characteristics superior to alternatives such as optocoupler devices. By avoiding the use of LEDs and photodiodes, iCoupler devices remove the design difficulties commonly associated with optocouplers. The typical optocoupler concerns regarding uncertain current transfer ratios, nonlinear transfer functions, and temperature and lifetime effects are eliminated with the simple iCoupler digital interfaces and stable performance characteristics. The need for external drivers and other discrete components is eliminated with these iCoupler products. Furthermore, iCoupler devices consume one-tenth to one-sixth the power of optocouplers at comparable signal data rates. The ADuM3210/ADuM3211 isolators provide two independent isolation channels in two channel configurations with data rates up to 25 Mbps. They operate with 3.3 V or 5 V supply voltages on either side, providing lower voltage systems, as well as enabling voltage translation functionality across the isolation barrier. The ADuM3210/ADuM3211 isolators have a default output low characteristic in comparison to the ADuM3200/ADuM3201 models, which have a default output high characteristic. The ADuM3210W and ADuM3211W models are automotive grade versions qualified for 125°C operation. In comparison to the ADuM1200/ADuM1201 isolator, the ADuM3210/ADuM3211 isolators contain various circuit and layout changes providing increased capability relative to system-level IEC 61000-4-x testing (ESD, burst, and surge). The precise capability in these tests for either the ADuM1200/ADuM1201 or ADuM3210/ADuM3211 products is strongly determined by the design and layout of the user's board or module.
