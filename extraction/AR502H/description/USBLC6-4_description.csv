General Description
"The USBLC6-4 is a monolithic application specific device dedicated to ESD protection of high speed interfaces, such as USB 2.0, Ethernet links, and video lines. Its very low line capacitance secures a high level of signal integrity without compromising in protecting sensitive chips against the most stringent characterized ESD strikes."
