General Description
"The VOS617A series is an optocoupler with a GaAs infrared emitting diode and a silicon planar phototransistor detector in a 4-pin mini-flat package. It provides high current transfer ratio, low coupling capacitance, and high isolation voltage, making it suitable for signal transmission between electrically separated circuits."
