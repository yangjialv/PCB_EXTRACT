General Description
"MX25U51245G is 512Mb bits Serial NOR Flash memory, which is configured as 67,108,864 x 8 internally. When it is in two or four I/O mode, the structure becomes 268,435,456 bits x 2 or 134,217,728 bits x 4. MX25U51245G feature a serial peripheral interface and software protocol allowing operation on a simple 3â€‘wire bus while it is in single I/O mode. The three bus signals are a clock input (SCLK), a serial data input (SI), and a serial data output (SO). Serial access to the device is enabled by CS# input. When it is in two I/O read mode, the SI pin and SO pin become SIO0 pin and SIO1 pin for address/dummy bits input and data output. When it is in four I/O read mode, the SI pin, SO pin, WP# and RESET# pin become SIO0 pin, SIO1 pin, SIO2 pin and SIO3 pin for address/dummy bits input and data output. The MX25U51245G MXSIMO (Serial Multi I/O) provides sequential read operation on the whole chip. After program/erase command is issued, auto program/erase algorithms which program/erase and verify the specified page or sector/block locations will be executed. Program command is executed on byte basis, or page (256 bytes) basis, or word basis for erase command is executed on sector (4K-byte), block (32K-byte), or block (64K-byte), or whole chip basis. To provide the user with ease of interface, a status register is included to indicate the status of the chip. The status read command can be issued to detect completion status of a program or erase operation via WIP bit. Advanced security features enhance the protection and security functions, please see security features section for more details. When the device is not in operation and CS# is high, it is put in standby mode. The MX25U51245G utilizes Macronix's proprietary memory cell, which reliably stores memory contents even after 100,000 program and erase cycles."
