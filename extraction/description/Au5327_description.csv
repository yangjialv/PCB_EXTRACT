General Description
"AU5327 is a programmable Quad PLL based jitter attenuating clock synthesizer with flexible input to output frequency translation options. It supports up to 4 input clocks and provides 8 clock outputs. The clock outputs can be derived from the 4 PLLs in a highly flexible manner. It is fully programmable via the I2C/SPI interface or an on-chip two time programmable non-volatile memory for factory preprogrammed devices. Using advanced design technology, it provides excellent integrated jitter performance as well as low frequency offset noise performance while working reliably for ambient temperatures from -40°C to 85°C. The chip has best in class transient performance features in terms of clock switching transients and repeatable input to output delays."
