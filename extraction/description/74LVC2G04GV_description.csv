General Description
"This dual inverter is designed for 1.65-V to 5.5-V VCC operation. The SN74LVC2G04 device performs the Boolean function Y = A. NanoFree package technology uses the die as the package, enabling a very small footprint. The device is fully specified for partial-power-down applications using Ioff circuitry, which disables the outputs and prevents current backflow in power-down mode."
