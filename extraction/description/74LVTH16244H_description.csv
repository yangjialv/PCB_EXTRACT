General Description
"The 74LVTH16244 and 74LVTN16244 are 16-bit high-performance buffers/line drivers with non-inverting 3-state outputs designed for 3.3V VCC operation. These devices can be operated as four 4-bit buffers, two 8-bit buffers, or one 16-bit buffer, and each buffer has a separate output enable input (nOE). When nOE is low, these devices pass data from the nAn inputs to the nYn outputs. When nOE is high, all outputs are in the high-impedance state. The 74LVTH16244 bus hold on data inputs eliminates the need for external pull-up/pull-down resistors to hold unused inputs."
