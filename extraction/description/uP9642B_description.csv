General Description
"The uP9642B is a Smart Power Stage (SPS) solution with fully optimized, integrated driver and MOSFETs for high-current, high frequency, synchronous buck DC-DC converters. The SPS enables higher performance at lower output voltages required by cutting edge CPU, GPU and DDR memory designs. The uP9642B also enables advanced high accuracy module temperature reporting and on-chip synchronous MOSFET current monitoring. The protection includes cycle-by-cycle over current protection, phase fault detection, preliminary over voltage protection, VCC/VDRV UVLO protection, and thermal shutdown. The uP9642B is optimized for CPU core power delivery. This device combined with a multi-phase buck PWM controller forms a complete core voltage regulator for advanced micro-processors."
