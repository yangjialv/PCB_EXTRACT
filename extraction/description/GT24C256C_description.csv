General Description
"The GT24C256C is an industrial standard electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) device that utilizes the industrial standard 2-wire interface for communications. The GT24C256C contains a memory array of 256Kb (32,768x8), which is organized in 64-byte per page. The EEPROM operates in a wide voltage range from 1.7V to 5.5V, which fits most applications. The product provides low-power operations and low standby current. The device is offered in Lead-free, RoHS, halogen free or Green package. The available package types are 8-pin SOIC, TSSOP, MSOP and UDFN. The GT24C256C is compatible to the standard 2-wire bus protocol. The simple bus consists of Serial Clock (SCL) and Serial Data (SDA) signals. Utilizing such bus protocol, a Master device, such as a microcontroller, can usually control one or more Slave devices, alike this GT24C256C. The bit stream over the SDA line includes a series of bytes, which identifies a particular Slave device, an instruction, an address within that Slave device, and a series of data, if appropriate. The GT24C256C also has a Write Protect function via WP pin to cease from overwriting the data stored inside the memory array. In order to refrain the state machine entering into a wrong state during power-up sequence or a power toggle off-on condition, a power on reset circuit is embedded. During power-up, the device does not respond to any instructions until the supply voltage (VCC) has reached an acceptable stable level above the reset threshold voltage. Once VCC passes the power on reset threshold, the device is reset and enters into the Standby mode. This would also avoid any inadvertent Write operations during power-up stage. During power-down process, the device will enter into standby mode, once VCC drops below the power on reset threshold voltage. In addition, the device will be in standby mode after receiving the Stop command, provided that no internal write operation is in progress. Nevertheless, it is not recommended to send a command until the VCC reaches its operating level."
