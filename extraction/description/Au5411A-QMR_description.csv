General Description
"The Au5411 is a 2.1 GHz, 10 output low-jitter clock fan-out buffer intended for low jitter, high frequency clock/data distribution and level translation. It can accept primary, secondary or crystal inputs that are single ended or fully differential, distributing the selected clock to two output driver banks and one LVCMOS output. The device supports 8 MHz to 50 MHz crystals or single ended clocks. Each output bank can be programmed to LVPECL, LVDS, HCSL or HiZ modes, with the LVCMOS output synchronized to the selected clock and switchable without glitches. Powered by a 3.3 V/2.5 V core supply and three independent 3.3 V/2.5 V output supplies, the single LVCMOS output can run at 1.8 V."
