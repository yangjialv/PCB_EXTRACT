General Description
"The SGM2049 is a high accuracy, low noise, very low dropout linear regulator. It is capable of supplying 2A output current with typical dropout voltage of only 75mV. The operating input voltage range is from 1.1V to 7V with BIAS and 1.4V to 7V without BIAS. The output voltage of the SGM2049 can be set from 0.8V to 3.95V in pin-selectable operation and adjusted from 0.8V to 5.2V by using an external resistor divider. Other features include logic-controlled shutdown mode, short-circuit current limit and thermal shutdown protection. The SGM2049 has automatic discharge function to quickly discharge VOUT in the disabled status. The SGM2049 is suitable for application which needs high accuracy, low noise and high current power supply, such as analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and RF components. With very high accuracy, remote sensing, and soft-start capabilities to reduce inrush current, the SGM2049 ensures the optimal system performance for powering digital loads such as FPGAs, DSPs and ASICs. The SGM2049 is available in Green TQFN-3.5x3.5-20L and TQFN-5x5-20L packages. It operates over an operating temperature range of -40°C to +125°C."
