General Description
"The TPL9053 is a series of 500-mA high PSRR, ultra-low noise, and low dropout linear regulators with high-output accuracy. The TPL9053 series supports adjustable output voltage ranging from 0.6 V to 5.3 V with an external resistor divider, and is stable with a 4.7-μF or larger ceramic output capacitor. It has a high PSRR of 89 dB at 1 kHz and 5.7-μVRMS ultra-low noise, making it very suitable for noise-sensitive applications such as high-performance analog devices or high-definition imaging equipment. Output shortage and thermal overload protection circuits improve reliability under heavy load conditions. The TPL9053 series is offered in a DFN2X2-8 package with an operating junction temperature range from –40°C to +125°C."
