NO,Pin Name,Pin Function,Pin description
7,BYP,I,"Bypass input pin. Connect a 10-nF ceramic capacitor from BYP to OUT to reduce output noise."
3,EN,I,"Regulator enable pin. Drive EN high to turn on the regulator, and drive EN low to turn off the regulator. For automatic startup, connect EN to IN directly."
6,FB,I,"Output voltage feedback pin. Connect to a resistor divider to adjust the output voltage."
2,GND,-,"Ground reference pin. Connect the GND pin to the PCB ground plane directly."
4,GS,-,"Internal reference pin. MUST connect GS pin to PCB ground plane directly."
1,IN,I,"Input voltage pin. Bypass IN to GND with a 10 μF or greater capacitor."
8,OUT,O,"Regulated output voltage pin. Bypass OUT to GND with a 4.7 μF or greater capacitor."
5,PG,I,"Open-drain power-good output pin. Connect a 100-kΩ pull-up resistor to the logic voltage supply, or leave this pin open if not used. PG goes LOW after the output voltage ramps above VPG_TH, and PG keeps HIGH when the output voltage is below the threshold."
