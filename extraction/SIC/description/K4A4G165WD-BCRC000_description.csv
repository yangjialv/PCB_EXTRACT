General Description
"This is a 4Gb DDR4 SDRAM E-die device organized as 32Mbit x16 I/Os x 8 banks, achieving high-speed double-data-rate transfer rates of up to 2400Mb/sec per pin (DDR4-2400) for general applications. It features posted CAS, programmable CWL, internal (self) calibration, on-die termination using ODT, and asynchronous reset. All control and address inputs are synchronized with externally supplied differential clocks, and I/Os use bidirectional strobes in a source synchronous manner. The device supports RAS/CAS multiplexing, operates with 1.2V and 2.5V supplies, and is available in a 96-ball FBGA (x16) package."
