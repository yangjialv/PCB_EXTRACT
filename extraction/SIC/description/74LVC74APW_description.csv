General Description
"The 74LVC74A is a dual edge triggered D-type flip-flop with individual data (nD) inputs, clock (nCP) inputs, set (nSD) and (nRD) inputs, and complementary nQ and nQ outputs. The set and reset are asynchronous active LOW inputs and operate independently of the clock input. Information on the data input is transferred to the nQ output on the LOW-to-HIGH transition of the clock pulse. The nD inputs must be stable one set-up time prior to the LOW-to-HIGH clock transition, for predictable operation. Schmitt trigger action at all inputs makes the circuit highly tolerant of slower input rise and fall times."
