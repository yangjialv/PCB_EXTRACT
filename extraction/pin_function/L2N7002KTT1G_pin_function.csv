NO,Pin Name,Pin Function,Pin description
1,Source,This pin is the MOSFET Source,"Typically connected to reference or ground in lowâˆ’side switching circuits. Provides the reference for controlling current flow through the MOSFET."
2,Gate,This pin is the MOSFET Gate,"Control terminal for the MOSFET channel. The voltage level at this pin relative to the Source determines conduction."
3,Drain,This pin is the MOSFET Drain,"Carries the load current when the MOSFET is turned on. Usually connected to the load or supply rail."
