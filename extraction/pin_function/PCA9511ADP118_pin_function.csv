NO,Pin Name,Pin Function,Pin description
1,ENABLE,Chip enable,"Grounding this input puts the part in a low current (< 1 Î¼A) mode. It also disables the rise time accelerators, isolates SDAIN from SDAOUT and isolates SCLIN from SCLOUT."
2,SCLOUT,"Serial clock output to and from the SCL bus on the card",""
3,SCLIN,"Serial clock input to and from the SCL bus on the backplane",""
4,GND,Ground,"Connect this pin to a ground plane for best results."
5,READY,"Open-drain output","Which pulls LOW when SDAIN and SCLIN are disconnected from SDAOUT and SCLOUT, and goes HIGH when the two sides are connected."
6,SDAIN,"Serial data input to and from the SDA bus on the backplane",""
7,SDAOUT,"Serial data output to and from the SDA bus on the card",""
8,VCC,"Power supply",""
